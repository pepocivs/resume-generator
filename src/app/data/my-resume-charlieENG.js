  "aboutMe": [
    "My name is Fco.Carlos and my passion for technology and computers defines me. I started my career as a technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, where I gained experience in computer support, repair and assembly of computers.",
    "During an enriching period of 4 months, I had the opportunity to do an internship in the UK, where I polished my technical and linguistic skills in English. After my internship, I worked at an Apple Premium Reseller in Ibiza, where I gained experience in repairing and assembling Apple computers, customer service and product sales.",
    "I have recently completed my Bachelor Degree in Web Application Development, where I have acquired skills in technologies such as responsive Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX, Java, PHP with Model View Controller and database management, as well as familiarizing myself with Frameworks such as Laravel or Vue and AWS. I am also open to training in other technologies such as SWIFT, , Python, Go, among others.",
    "Geographical mobility is not an obstacle for me. I am a versatile and creative person, always looking for innovative solutions to any challenge. I am eager to keep learning and growing in a professional environment."

Although my mobility was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experience was worth it.",
        "During my stay in the UK, I not only improved my English, but also gained professional, work and personal experience. I learned about the assembly, maintenance, disassembly, repair and recycling of computers, laptops and smartphones, as well as customer service and warehouse logistics. I also learned about installing Windows and Linux operating systems directly from the company network, optimising the software and acquiring in-depth knowledge of the operating systems.",
        "In addition, I learned about confidentiality, privacy and the philosophy of our clients. Although the experience had some difficult moments, such as arriving with a suitcase to a flat to live with strangers and coming to work on the second day without knowing anyone and learning to deal with challenging circumstances, it helped me grow as a person and as a worker. My boss and colleagues showed me a profound human quality, which helped me to increase my social skills, be more proactive and work as part of a team. I also learned a lot about the English culture, which is very different from the Spanish one.",
